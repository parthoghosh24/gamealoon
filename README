Gamealoon v0.0.1 
=====================================

Bitbucket git handle- https://pghosh2486@bitbucket.org/eboie2013/gamealoon.git

Gamealoon, a eboie production, is first of its kind crowdsourcing based gaming digital media and entertainment product. This product has been conceived
with the notion that in every passionate gamer out there, there is a great content writer. Here gamers can share their views in the form of review, preview,
news and various form of articles. Great writers will be ranked and their articles will be highlighted and also they
can be followed by other users. A basic flow of the system is as follows:

-> User registers with the system and logs in
-> User will have a profile page which will have various details about articles written, users followed, achievements earned, various game related stats and who are following the user.
-> From his/her profile page, user will be able to access an editor section via which user will be able to publish articles- such as reviews, previews, etc.
-> The system will follow the basic structure of a typical gaming website- such as gamespot and ign, but here the difference the sections are filled by user's content.
-> User articles will be ranked according to their reputation and will be displayed accordingly.


Technical notes:

-> App should be designed and developed in the form of an API.
-> All the views (browser, mobile, etc.) should interact via JSON with this API.

Tools used:
-> Play 2.1.0
-> JDK 7 (64 bit)
-> Eclipse Juno with EGIT plugin installed
-> Mongo DB 2.4.1
-> Morphia 0.99 and its SL4j extension
